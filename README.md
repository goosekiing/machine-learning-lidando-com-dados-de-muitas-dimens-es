# Machine Learning: Dealing with High Dimensional Data

This repository contains a project focused on using machine learning techniques to handle high-dimensional data. The dataset includes results from various medical exams used to determine whether a specific type of cancer is malignant or benign. The data is scaled, correlations are evaluated, and a classifier is used to identify the main parameters for assessing cancer type and to develop the best model for this problem.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore methods for handling and analyzing high-dimensional data to build an effective machine learning model for cancer classification.

## Course Details
This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning course on Alura. For more information about the course, visit [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-machine-learning-v64177).
